#A working title

You can see a working version of this project on [Heroku](https://bwalen.herokuapp.com/)

##About
For my second project, I decided to build a movie lists app where you are able to track which movies you want to watch and have a visual representation of each movie.  The app enables you to search for a movie by a title, or use discovery options to find movies the user find movies that they did not even know they wanted to watch.  The user will also be able to name and share their movie lists with other users, view trailers of the movies they want to see, and find links where to get the content provided.
